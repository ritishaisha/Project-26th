The cook time in your microwave could be anywhere between 1 minute and 1 minute and 15 seconds. Check the cookie after 1 minute. Once it comes out of the microwave it should be very soft. Allow the cookie to cool slightly for 5 minutes to allow it to set before eating. Enjoy warm. DO NOT over bake! Please be precise and use the exact amounts in the recipe.
